## General information
This repository was created by Chris Gomez and is for Homework 3 

This dataset is from: Chris Gomez (2025) 

Data from: Do I take more steps during a morning work shift?

## Data and file information 
There are two folders, a code folder and a data folder. All code is in the code folder, and all datasets are in the data folder. 

In the code folder, there is a file called ENVS-193_homework-03_TEMPLATE which contains all code for this assignment. The code runs models, generates model predictions, and visualizes data.
