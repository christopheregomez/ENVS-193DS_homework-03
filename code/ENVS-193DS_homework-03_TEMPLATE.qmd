# Set up

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(gt)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(png)
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)

steps <- read_xlsx( # creating an object for my data
  here("data", "work-steps.xlsx"),
  sheet = "Sheet1")
```

# Problem 1. Personal data

## a. 

I could compare my mean step count at work between a morning shift and a non-morning shift because work is busier during a morning shift, so I think I take more steps during a morning shift. 

## b. 

```{r}
steps_clean <- steps |> # making clean new object from steps
  clean_names() |> # cleaning column names
  mutate(opening_shift = case_when( # rename opening_shift column
    opening_shift == "Yes" ~ "Morning", # renaming "Yes" to "morning"
    opening_shift == "No" ~ "Non-morning")) |> # renaming "No" to "non-morning"
  select(opening_shift, number_of_steps) # selecting certain columns 
names(steps_clean)[names(steps_clean) == "opening_shift"] <- "Shift"

t.test( # t-test
  number_of_steps ~ Shift, # formula: response variable ~ grouping variable
  var.equal = TRUE, # argument for equal/unequal variances
  data = steps_clean) # using steps_clean data frame

steps_ci <- steps_clean |> # making new steps_ci object from steps_clean
  group_by(Shift) |> # grouping by "opening shift"
  summarize(ci = mean_cl_normal(number_of_steps)) # calculating the 95% CI

ggplot(data = steps_clean, # using steps_clean data frame 
       aes(x = Shift, # x-axis
           y = number_of_steps, # y-axis
           color = Shift)) + # coloring points by opening_shift
  geom_jitter(height = 0, # no jitter in the vertical direction 
              width = 0.1, # smaller jitter in the horizontal direction 
              alpha = 0.4, # making the points more transparent 
              shape = 17) + # making the points triangles 
  geom_pointrange(data = steps_ci, # using the steps_ci data frame
                  aes(x = Shift, # x-axis
                      y = ci$y, # y-axis
                      ymax = ci$ymax, # upper bound of confidence interval
                      ymin = ci$ymin)) + # lower bound of confidence interval 
  labs(x = "Shift Type", # labeling x-axis
       y = "Step Count") + # labeling y-axis
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Morning" = "blue3", # coloring "Morning" blue
                                "Non-morning" = "green3")) + # coloring "Non-morning" green
  theme_bw() + # using a theme
  theme(legend.position = "none") # removing legend
```

## c. 

Comparing step counts between morning shifts and non-morning shifts. The mean step counts of morning shifts (12,785) is higher than the mean step count of non-morning shifts (12,054).  

## d. 

```{r}
steps_summary <- steps_clean |> # make new object from "steps_clean"
  group_by(Shift) |> # group by shift
  summarize(mean = mean(number_of_steps), # calculate the mean
            ci = mean_cl_normal(number_of_steps)) |> # calculate the 95% CI
  mutate(mean = round(mean, 1), # round mean to one decimal
         ci = round(ci, 1)) |> # round the CI to one decimal
  gt() # make a gt table
gt_tbl <- steps_summary |> # use the "step_summary" data frame
    tab_header(title = "Steps Summary") # make a table header
  
gt_tbl
```

# Problem 2: Affective visualization 

## a. 

An affective visualization for my personal data would divide the paper in two with a line and each side would include dashed lines to represent my steps walked. I would color code the dashed lines to compare the type of shift. For my morning shift data I would use orange and red to visualize the sunrise. Then for my non-morning shift data I would use blue and purple to visualize the afternoon and night. I would also show the difference in how many steps I take by increasing the density of dashed lines for morning shifts than non morning shifts.
