# Set up

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(gt)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(png)
library(knitr)
library(rmarkdown)

steps <- read_xlsx( # creating an object for my data
  here("data", "work-steps.xlsx"),
  sheet = "Sheet1")
```

# Problem 1. Personal data

## a. 

I could compare my mean step count at work between a morning shift and a non-morning shift because work is busier during a morning shift, so I think I take more steps during a morning shift.
